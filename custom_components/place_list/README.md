# Place List
The Place List component is a custom HTML element that functions like a standard Site Studio component, but is defined through custom code. It provides a way to fetch and display people from a JSON API endpoint, with the base URL as the only required field. Optional fields include the filter by title and filter number, allowing you to limit the number of articles displayed.
